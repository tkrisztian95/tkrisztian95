👋 Hello there! I'm Krisztián, a dedicated Software Engineer with a profound love for Test-Driven Development (TDD) and an unwavering commitment to quality code. I thrive on turning ideas into reality through meticulous coding practices and creative problem-solving.

I've had the privilege of working on projects that demanded a keen eye for detail and a passion for delivering nothing but the best. I believe in the power of collaboration and open source.
